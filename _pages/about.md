Hi, I’m David Pohl, an M.Sc. student at the Institute of Science Tokyo, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Naoaki Okazaki](https://www.chokkan.org/index.en.html). I am also a Software Engineering Intern at Woven by Toyota and a Research Scholar at the University of Tokyo under the supervision of Prof. [Toyotaro Suzumura](https://sites.google.com/view/toyolab/suzumura-1).
I completed my B.Sc. at Heidelberg University in Germany, supervised by Prof. [Michael Gertz](https://ds.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/team/gertz/).

My research centers on tokenization in large language models during both pretraining and inference. I am also interested in news recommendation systems, which play an increasingly important role for stable societies.
Beyond these topics, I have not encountered a topic in NLP or ML that I did not want to hear more about. If you’d like to chat, collaborate, or exchange ideas, please feel free to reach out.
