### About Me
Hi, I’m David Pohl, an M.Sc. student at the Institute of Science Tokyo (formerly Tokyo Institute of Technology). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Naoaki Okazaki](https://www.chokkan.org/index.en.html). I am also a Software Engineering Intern at Woven by Toyota and a Research Scholar at the University of Tokyo under the supervision of Prof. [Toyotaro Suzumura](https://sites.google.com/view/toyolab/suzumura-1).
I completed my B.Sc. at Heidelberg University in Germany, supervised by Prof. [Michael Gertz](https://ds.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/team/gertz/).

My research centers on tokenization in large language models during both pretraining and inference. I am also interested in news recommendation systems, which play an increasingly important role for stable societies.
Beyond these topics, I have not encountered a topic in NLP or ML that I did not want to hear more about. If you’d like to chat, collaborate, or exchange ideas, please feel free to reach out.

### Publications

**Strategies for LLM Marginalization**\
David Pohl, Marco Cognetta, Junyoung Lee, Naoaki Okazaki.\
(under review)\
TLDR: We proposed a novel automata-based sampling method for efficient marginalization, achieving orders-of-magnitude speedups over model-based sampling at an equal or improved accuracy

**Pitfalls, Subtleties, and Techniques in Automata-Based Subword-Level Constrained Generation**\
Marco Cognetta*, David Pohl*, Junyoung Lee, Naoaki Okazaki.\
(Tokenization Workshop at ICML 2025)\
TLDR: We addressed key challenges in automata-based constrained generation for subword-level LLMs and proposed a unified pipeline ensuring reliability, extensibility, and testability

**Online DATEing: A Web Interface for Temporal Annotations**\
Dennis Aumiller, Satya Almasian, David Pohl, Michael Gertz.\
